# Global Furniture GTM Plan 2026

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Expand in the Northeast**: Specifically targeting urban millennials with compact furniture lines.
2. **Launch 'Eco-Office' Line**: Sustainable office furniture is our biggest bet for Q2 2026.
3. **B2B Partnerships**: Secure contracts with 3 major hotel chains by Q3.

## Key Risks
- **Supply Chain**: Timber shortages in Southeast Asia may delay the 'Oak Dining' series.
- **Logistics**: Fuel prices affecting last-mile delivery costs in the West region.

## Marketing Focus
- Shift 40% of budget to Instagram and TikTok ads for the 'Cloud Sofa'.
- Discontinue print catalogs by end of 2026.
